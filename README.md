# 30 Days of JavaScript LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my **30 Days of JavaScript from LeetCode** challenge! In this repository, I’ll be solving one LeetCode problem each day, sharing solutions along with explanations, insights, and strategies. This project is not only an exercise to improve coding and problem-solving skills but also a repository of optimized and efficient code solutions.

## About This Repository

This repository is designed to:
- **Track Progress**: Commit daily solutions with detailed explanations.
- **Document Learning**: Explore various approaches and algorithms.
- **Build a Code Portfolio**: Showcase my problem-solving skills and structured coding practices.
- **Encourage Consistency**: Challenge myself to code and solve problems consistently.

Each solution will be organized by date and problem title, with clear instructions, solution details, and code comments.

## Problem-Solving Approach

Each solution will follow a structured approach:
1. **Understand the Problem**: Read and interpret the problem statement and constraints.
2. **Plan an Approach**: Decide on an algorithm or strategy to solve the problem.
3. **Code the Solution**: Implement the solution with clean, modular code.
4. **Optimize**: Evaluate time and space complexity and optimize where possible.
5. **Document**: Provide explanations and explore alternative approaches if relevant.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (or preferred language)
- **Platform**: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/)

## Goals
- **30 problems, 30 days**
- **Sharpen coding skills and reinforce algorithmic knowledge**
- **Build a professional repository that demonstrates structured problem-solving**

## How to Use

You can clone this repository and explore each day’s problem and solution. Each day's folder contains:
- **Problem-Description.md**: The problem statement and requirements.
- **Solution**: The coded solution, optimized for readability and efficiency.
- **Explanation.md**: Commentary on the solution and other possible methods.
